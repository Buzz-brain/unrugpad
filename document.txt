UnrugpadToken Contract Verification & Deployment Documentation
============================================================

1. Contract Preparation
----------------------
- Developed `UnrugpadToken.sol` as a UUPS upgradeable BEP-20 token using OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts.
- Included fee logic, liquidity, and admin controls.
- Used Hardhat for compilation and deployment.

2. Compilation & Build Info
---------------------------
- Compiled with Solidity v0.8.24, optimization enabled (200 runs), EVM version Paris.
- Generated build-info JSON for Standard JSON-Input verification.

3. Deployment
-------------
- Deployed via a factory contract (`UnrugpadTokenFactory`) using the ERC1967Proxy pattern.
- Proxy contract address created on BSC.
- Implementation contract address stored in the proxy (EIP-1967 standard slot).

4. Proxy Verification Attempt
-----------------------------
- Attempted to verify the proxy contract on BscScan using Standard JSON-Input.
- Encountered bytecode mismatch (proxy only contains minimal logic).
- Learned that only the implementation contract should be verified for full ABI/source code.

5. Finding Implementation Address
---------------------------------
- Located the implementation contract address using BscScan's "Read Contract" tab and/or "Get Storage At" tool with slot:
  0x360894A13BA1A3210667C828492DB98DCA3E2076CC3735A920A3CA505D382BBC
- Confirmed implementation address: 0xce5eef386eeb576dbdd0c222e1731ca87b6ff4f5

6. Implementation Contract Verification
---------------------------------------
- Navigated to the implementation contract address on BscScan.
- Verified and published the source code using Standard JSON-Input (matching compiler settings).
- BscScan automatically linked proxy to implementation, enabling full ABI and source code display.

7. Confirmation & Results
-------------------------
- Proxy contract now shows full ABI and source code.
- "Read as Proxy" and "Write as Proxy" tabs available.
- Contract is publicly verified and users can interact with it.
- Frontend and integrations can now use the ABI for token display and interaction.

8. Key Learnings
----------------
- For upgradeable contracts, always verify the implementation contract, not the proxy.
- Use the EIP-1967 storage slot to find the implementation address.
- BscScan will link proxy and implementation automatically after verification.

Here’s what I recommend next for a robust, user-friendly dashboard:

Update the dashboard to show all tokens held by the connected wallet, not just those deployed.

This way, any user who receives tokens via transfer will see them in their dashboard.
Test the transfer, approve, and balance features with multiple wallets.

Send tokens to another wallet and confirm they appear in the recipient’s dashboard.
Try approving and checking balances for different addresses.
Add a “Refresh” or “Sync” button.

Let users manually refresh their token list after receiving tokens.
Optional: Add a “Token Search” or “Import” feature.

Allow users to add tokens by contract address if they don’t show up automatically.
